README

This database contains sample non-complementary responses to aggression. The database consists of three csvs,

1. Non-complementary aggression responses (general)
2. Non-complementary aggression responses (online)
3. Non-complementary aggression response (online pairs)

(1) contains general non-complementary aggression responses
(2) is mostly for use on social media or in other situations where there is an interpersonal conflict via the internet.
(3) suggests reponse pairs for specific types of aggression based on observed events

What's a non-complementary response? Glad you asked...

NON-COMPLEMENTARY RESPONSES

Non-complementary response theory is based on interaction typology developed by Gregory Bateson and Timothy Leary.
In the contemporary era, Maeril, the City of Boston, Transport for London, and Rutger Bregman (among others) have suggested normative approaches to aggression response using this theory.
The basic idea is that instead of responding to aggression (like trolling or harassment) through an "expected" response, you respond via an unexpected response.
In most circumstances, non-complementary responses are intended to:

- Keep victims and intervening bystanders safe
- Build communities
- Avoid platforming or giving unnecessary oxygen to aggressors
